# Overview

This is a small story-like game based on the decitions made by the player. The idea here is to present certain situations to the palyer and let ot choose from a pool of actions and see the consequences of it. 

I used C-sharp to create it thanks to an easy access to classes, which did help a lot to achieve the results. The software will, similar to an RPG game, ask what kind of warrior you are, select objects, toss items, write letters, and more. There is also a small fight, so watch you HP bar!

The main purpose of tis was to understand the concept of Classes and how to use them. I do believe I achieved a new level with C-sharp. I look forward to learn ore of Object Oriented Languages.

# Future Work

Of course this is a beta of the actual game. It only hold a few situations, later on we`ll add more story. 

Also, I need to add more features such as Items class, level, experience points and more. 

I also need to optimize in the future the way I shuffle the situations. Do I want them ramdom or linear? I will need to think about it.
